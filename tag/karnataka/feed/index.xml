<p style="font-size:22px">The controversy over &#8216;hijab&#8217; in Karnataka is finding resonance in street protests and social media outrage across the country. The Karnataka government has defended its decision in the Karnataka High Court and argued that religious symbolism should not be worn in educational institutions which have a prescribed dress code,</p>



<p style="font-size:22px">On Wednesday, the single judge bench hearing the matter in the Karnataka High Court sent the case to the Chief Justice Ritu Raj Awasthi to set up a larger bench as the case brings up “wider issues”.</p>

<p style="font-size:22px">The state government and the colleges have stuck to their argument that a dress code must be followed and that religious clothing does not have a place in an educational institution, which depends of “equality and uniformity&#8221;.</p>



<p style="font-size:22px">The government has argued that allowing overt display of religious symbolism through clothing would &#8220;lead to a student acquiring a distinct identity&#8221; which would be &#8220;not conducive to academic environment&#8221;. The state has also defended its decision as a means to &#8220;protect public order&#8221;.]

<p style="font-size:22px">On the other hand, the&nbsp;<strong>petitioners have claimed violation of their fundamental right</strong>&nbsp;to profess their religion, and the right to freedom and dignity. The lawyers for petitioners argued before the court that the Constitution gives everyone the fundamental right to practice their religion, and barring students from attending classes due to their dress violates these fundamental rights.</p>

<p style="font-size:22px">A similar argument relating to “uniformity” were before the European Court of Human Rights in the cases involving ban on veils in France and Belgium. In both cases, in 2014 in the France veil ban issue and in 2017 Belgium case, the ECHR upheld the ban on the veils that cover the full face and head.</p>



<p style="font-size:22px">However, these bans were upheld on the grounds of gender equality concerns (France), and “preservation of the condition of living together” which allows persons to see and identify each other. However, neither of these doctrines are valid when it comes to a Hijab. The hijab is a scarf that covers only a person’s head and hair, unlike a full face veil or ‘Niqab’, which was the subject of controversy in the European cases.</p>

<p style="font-size:22px">In India, the issue of religious clothing or symbols is not new. While the Karnataka government has raised the argument that “religious symbols and clothing” cannot be allowed, other state high courts have permitted students to do so in various cases.</p>



<p style="font-size:22px">In 2016, the Kerala High Court in a case relating to dress code during the All India Pre Medical Entrance exams(AIPMT), allowed Muslim women candidates to wear hijab to the test centers.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://abhishek-tiwaari.github.io/ViralNewsBuzz/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/hijabprotest-1644380207.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-48" width="833" height="467" srcset="https://abhishek-tiwaari.github.io/ViralNewsBuzz/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/hijabprotest-1644380207.jpg 715w, https://abhishek-tiwaari.github.io/ViralNewsBuzz/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/hijabprotest-1644380207-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 833px) 100vw, 833px" /></figure>



<p style="font-size:22px">“The right of women to have the choice of dress based on religious injunctions is a fundamental right protected under Article 25(1), when such prescription of dress is an essential part of the religion. As has been noted above, that right can be negated only in any of the circumstances referred under Article 25(1). The attempt of the Board to ensure transparency and credibility of the examinations also cannot be ignored by this Court. However, the approach of the Court is always to harmoniously accommodate the competing interest without there being any conflict or repugnancy. The interest of the Board can be safeguarded by allowing the invigilator to frisk such candidates including by removing scarf. However, safeguard has to be ensured that this must be done honouring the religious sentiments of the candidates,” held the bench.</p>

<p style="font-size:22px">The single judge bench directed the CBSE to ensure that women invigilators could be appointed to frisk the women candidates to ensure that they were not conducting any malpractice or carrying cheat sheets into the exams.</p>



<p style="font-size:22px">When the CBSE challenged the judgment, a two-judge bench upheld the verdict, and noted that the CBSE itself had included the provision that “candidates coming in customary/religious dresses should report at the centre latest by 8.30 am for proper frisking”.</p>

<p style="font-size:22px">The Delhi High Court also passed similar orders in 2018, where a division bench directed the CBSE to allow a Sikh candidate wearing kara and kirpan to enter the NEET exam hall, even though the dress code banned any metal items.</p>



<p style="font-size:22px">The bench had in its order noted that the candidates, who were wearing such religious symbols, could be called in one hour early for frisking to ensure that there is no misuse of the objects.</p>



<p style="font-size:22px">In 2002, the Bombay High Court also took up a case involving ban on hijab as part of a school dress code. The court, in the Fathima Hussain Syedcase in 2002, noted that wearing of hijab was a part of essential practice of Islam as cited in various verses of the Quran. However, the court dismissed the case itself, as the girl was attending an all-girls school.</p>



<p style="font-size:22px">“A girl student not wearing the head-scarf or head covering studying in exclusive girls section cannot be said to in any manner acting inconsistent with the aforesaid verse 31 or violating any injunction provided in Holy Quran. It is not an obligatory overt act enjoined by Muslim religion that a girl studying in all girl section must wear head-covering. The essence of Muslim religion or Islam cannot be said to have been interfered with by directing petitioner not to wear headscarf in school,” noted the Bombay High Court in its verdict.</p>



<p style="font-size:26px"><strong>What do experts say?</strong></p>



<p style="font-size:22px">Speaking to News channels, senior advocate Dushyant Dave said the controversy over hijab in Karnataka was a “political issue being deliberately raised during elections&#8221;.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="555" src="https://abhishek-tiwaari.github.io/ViralNewsBuzz/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/photo-1024x555.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-49" srcset="https://abhishek-tiwaari.github.io/ViralNewsBuzz/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/photo-1024x555.jpg 1024w, https://abhishek-tiwaari.github.io/ViralNewsBuzz/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/photo-300x163.jpg 300w, https://abhishek-tiwaari.github.io/ViralNewsBuzz/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/photo-768x416.jpg 768w, https://abhishek-tiwaari.github.io/ViralNewsBuzz/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/photo.jpg 1070w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p style="font-size:22px">“The government has no right to interfere in clothing worn by a person. It is the personal freedom and choice of each person. Even if there is a dress Code, the Hijab or headscarf can be of the same colour and cloth as the rest of the uniform, so as to not violate the dress code,” said Dave.</p>



<p style="font-size:22px">Senior advocate Vikas Singh also said that the ban violated the rights to practice and profess religion enshrined under article 25 and 29 of the Constitution. “The argument of restrictions for the sake of Public order cannot arise here. Public order has to be defined in the light of causing offence or public disorder. How is that affected by a headscarf? Courts have held that carrying a kirpan for Sikhs and covering the head for Muslims is an essential religious practice,” said Singh.</p>
