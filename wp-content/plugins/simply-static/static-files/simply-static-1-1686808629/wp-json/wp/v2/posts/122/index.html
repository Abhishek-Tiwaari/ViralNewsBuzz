The central bank has been working on modalities for central bank digital currency. However, it has expressed reservations on private cryptocurrencies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das has already said that cryptocurrencies are a very serious concern from the macro-economic and financial stability perspective. CBDCs are presently mostly in the hypothetical stage, with some in proof-of-concept programmes. However, more than 80 per cent of central banks are looking at digital currencies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\tatOptions = {\n\t\t'key' : '7913fb0db23f47ade957213e6ec50696',\n\t\t'format' : 'iframe',\n\t\t'height' : 90,\n\t\t'width' : 728,\n\t\t'params' : {}\n\t};\n\tdocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"http' + (location.protocol === 'https:' ?

On September 27, 2021, Tajikistan announced the creation of a CBDC with the Fantom Foundation, and Nigeria was the first African country to launch its CBDC on October 25.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">The Bank of America said in its recent report that a US CBDC would differ from the digital money currently available to the public because it would be a liability of the US Federal Reserve, not a commercial bank, and so would have no credit or liquidity risk.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">The US Fed has also published a discussion paper on the benefits and risks of a CBDC. Earlier, the Indian government was slated to introduce new regulations for cryptocurrency during the Winter Session of Parliament, which kicked off on November 29. The session ended without seeing the &#8216;The Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill, 2021&#8217;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Budget 2022 LIVE: \u0935\u093f\u0924\u094d\u0924 \u092e\u0902\u0924\u094d\u0930\u0940 \u0915\u0940 \u092c\u0921\u093c\u0940 \u0918\u094b\u0937\u0923\u093e, Digital Currency \u0932\u0949\u0928\u094d\u091a \u0915\u0930\u0947\u0917\u0940 RBI\" width=\"1110\" height=\"624\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/QmJEJq7w9RE?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\tatOptions = {\n\t\t'key' : '7913fb0db23f47ade957213e6ec50696',\n\t\t'format' : 'iframe',\n\t\t'height' : 90,\n\t\t'width' : 728,\n\t\t'params' : {}\n\t};\n\tdocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"http' + (location.protocol === 'https:' ?
