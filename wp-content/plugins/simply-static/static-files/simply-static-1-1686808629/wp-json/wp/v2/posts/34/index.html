In both cases, in 2014 in the France veil ban issue and in 2017 Belgium case, the ECHR upheld the ban on the veils that cover the full face and head.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">However, these bans were upheld on the grounds of gender equality concerns (France), and \u201cpreservation of the condition of living together\u201d which allows persons to see and identify each other. However, neither of these doctrines are valid when it comes to a Hijab. The hijab is a scarf that covers only a person\u2019s head and hair, unlike a full face veil or \u2018Niqab\u2019, which was the subject of controversy in the European cases.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\tatOptions = {\n\t\t'key' : '7913fb0db23f47ade957213e6ec50696',\n\t\t'format' : 'iframe',\n\t\t'height' : 90,\n\t\t'width' : 728,\n\t\t'params' : {}\n\t};\n\tdocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"http' + (location.protocol === 'https:' ?

As has been noted above, that right can be negated only in any of the circumstances referred under Article 25(1). The attempt of the Board to ensure transparency and credibility of the examinations also cannot be ignored by this Court. However, the approach of the Court is always to harmoniously accommodate the competing interest without there being any conflict or repugnancy. The interest of the Board can be safeguarded by allowing the invigilator to frisk such candidates including by removing scarf. However, safeguard has to be ensured that this must be done honouring the religious sentiments of the candidates,\u201d held the bench.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\tatOptions = {\n\t\t'key' : '7913fb0db23f47ade957213e6ec50696',\n\t\t'format' : 'iframe',\n\t\t'height' : 90,\n\t\t'width' : 728,\n\t\t'params' : {}\n\t};\n\tdocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"http' + (location.protocol === 'https:' ?

The court, in the Fathima Hussain Syedcase in 2002, noted that wearing of hijab was a part of essential practice of Islam as cited in various verses of the Quran. However, the court dismissed the case itself, as the girl was attending an all-girls school.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">\u201cA girl student not wearing the head-scarf or head covering studying in exclusive girls section cannot be said to in any manner acting inconsistent with the aforesaid verse 31 or violating any injunction provided in Holy Quran. It is not an obligatory overt act enjoined by Muslim religion that a girl studying in all girl section must wear head-covering. The essence of Muslim religion or Islam cannot be said to have been interfered with by directing petitioner not to wear headscarf in school,\u201d noted the Bombay High Court in its verdict.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-size:26px\"><strong>What do experts say?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">Speaking to News channels, senior advocate Dushyant Dave said the controversy over hijab in Karnataka was a \u201cpolitical issue being deliberately raised during elections&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"555\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/ViralNewsBuzzz\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/photo-1024x555.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-49\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost\/ViralNewsBuzzz\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/photo-1024x555.jpg 1024w, http:\/\/localhost\/ViralNewsBuzzz\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/photo-300x163.jpg 300w, http:\/\/localhost\/ViralNewsBuzzz\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/photo-768x416.jpg 768w, http:\/\/localhost\/ViralNewsBuzzz\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/photo.jpg 1070w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">\u201cThe government has no right to interfere in clothing worn by a person. It is the personal freedom and choice of each person. Even if there is a dress Code, the Hijab or headscarf can be of the same colour and cloth as the rest of the uniform, so as to not violate the dress code,\u201d said Dave.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-size:22px\">Senior advocate Vikas Singh also said that the ban violated the rights to practice and profess religion enshrined under article 25 and 29 of the Constitution. \u201cThe argument of restrictions for the sake of Public order cannot arise here. Public order has to be defined in the light of causing offence or public disorder. How is that affected by a headscarf?
