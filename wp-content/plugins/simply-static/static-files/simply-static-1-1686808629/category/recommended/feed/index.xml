Some information may be out of date.&nbsp;Visit our&nbsp;coronavirus hub&nbsp;and follow our&nbsp;live updates page&nbsp;for the most recent information on the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>



<p style="font-size:22px">Over a year has passed since SARS-CoV-2 began to spread across the world. Its appearance, which first caused mild concern, soon turned into serious worry as more people received a diagnosis of COVID-19.</p>



<script type="text/javascript">

<p style="font-size:22px">In the beginning, scientists knew very little about this novel virus and the disease it caused. The unknowns and the virus’s remarkably rapid spread incited fear among health professionals, scientists, and the public.</p>



<p style="font-size:22px">Soon, restricted travel, lockdowns, mask mandates, and physical distancing protocols were implemented as a tactic to slow COVID-19’s spread. Widespread media coverage detailed every nuance of an ever-changing pandemic landscape as world leaders and health experts waged war on this invisible threat.</p>



<p style="font-size:22px">Worldwide, there have been over <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://covid19.who.int/" target="_blank">150 million</a> confirmed cases of COVID-19, with just over 3 million deaths attributed to the disease. According to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2021/05/05/health/cdc-model-covid-19-cases-study/index.html" target="_blank">official projections</a>, in some countries, such as the United States, the rate of new SARS-CoV-2 infections is gradually declining.</p>



<script type="text/javascript">

</script>



<p style="font-size:22px">This decrease is likely due to increased herd immunity and the introduction of vaccines. To date, approximately&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01136-2" target="_blank">1 billion vaccine dosesTrusted Source</a>&nbsp;have been administered across the globe.</p>



<p style="font-size:22px">As a result, some countries,&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/explainers-52530518" target="_blank">such as the United Kingdom</a>, are beginning to soften protocols initially put in place to stop the spread of the virus. As lockdowns lift, many people who were unable to leave their house are now going out and enjoying life as best they can while still being mindful of safety.</p>



<p style="font-size:23px"><strong>Yet, for some, going back out and mixing with other people is a concept filled with fear and anxiety. Despite vaccines and a decrease in disease prevalence, some people experience what scientists call COVID-19 anxiety syndrome.</strong></p>



<p style="font-size:22px">Symptoms of this syndrome mimic those of other mental health conditions, including anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). And, the pandemic and related factors appear to be the cause.</p>

<p style="font-size:22px">At the beginning of the pandemic, most people were on high alert, experiencing fear and worry over the impact this virus may have. As scientists and health care professionals gained more understanding of the virus and how to treat the symptoms of COVID-19, society began to settle into a new and unfamiliar routine of living with a pandemic.</p>



<p style="font-size:22px">Throughout this global health emergency, reactions have varied widely. Some people refused to change their behavior, while others followed the rules strictly to avoid contracting the virus. However, on a larger scale, most people experienced a sudden disruption in their lives.</p>



<p style="font-size:22px">Disaster situations often have the same effect.</p>



<p style="font-size:22px">The&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.ifrc.org/en/what-we-do/disaster-management/about-disasters/what-is-a-disaster/#:~:text=A%20disaster%20is%20a%20sudden,cope%20using%20its%20own%20resources." target="_blank">International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies</a>&nbsp;classify a disaster as “a sudden, catastrophic event that severely disrupts the functioning of a community or society, causing human, material, economic, or environmental losses.”</p>



<p style="font-size:22px">A disaster can have far-reaching consequences on mental health. According to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6857396/" target="_blank">researchTrusted Source</a>, a disaster may precipitate PTSD, anxiety, and depression among the population. People with mental health conditions, women, children, and older adults are most at risk.</p>

</script>



<p style="font-size:23px"><strong>These mental health consequences of a disaster also occurred with the COVID-19 pandemic. Statistics recorded by the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6932a1.htm" target="_blank">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)Trusted Source</a>&nbsp;between June 24–30, 2020, show that around 40% of adults in the U.S. reported at least one adverse mental health concern, including anxiety, depression, substance use, and suicidal ideation.</strong></p>



<p style="font-size:22px">As more understanding of pandemic-related mental health consequences evolved, scientists identified an emerging group of anxiety-related symptoms and behaviors associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. They classify this phenomenon as COVID-19 anxiety syndrome.</p>



<p style="font-size:28px"><strong>What is COVID-19 anxiety syndrome?</strong></p>

<p style="font-size:22px">Profs Ana Nikčević from Kingston University of London and Marcantonio Spada from London South Bank University, both in the U.K., developed the concept of COVID-19 anxiety syndrome.</p>



<p style="font-size:22px">In a paper that appears in <em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7375349/" target="_blank">Psychiatry ResearchTrusted Source</a></em> in October 2020, Profs Nikčević and Spada outline the characteristics of COVID-19 anxiety syndrome, naming avoidance, compulsive symptom-checking, worrying, and threat monitoring (combined).</p>

<p style="font-size:23px"><strong>This syndrome manifests as the inability to leave the house because of COVID-19 fears, frequent checking for symptoms despite not being in a high-risk scenario, and avoiding social situations or people.</strong></p>



<p style="font-size:22px">Investigators note that people with this syndrome tend to experience increased post-traumatic stress, general stress, anxiety, health anxiety, and suicidal ideation.</p>



<p style="font-size:28px"><strong>Possible causes of COVID-19 anxiety</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="536" src="https://abhishek-tiwaari.github.io/ViralNewsBuzz/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/anxietyvscovid19-1024x536.png" alt="" class="wp-image-105" srcset="https://abhishek-tiwaari.github.io/ViralNewsBuzz/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/anxietyvscovid19-1024x536.png 1024w, https://abhishek-tiwaari.github.io/ViralNewsBuzz/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/anxietyvscovid19-300x157.png 300w, https://abhishek-tiwaari.github.io/ViralNewsBuzz/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/anxietyvscovid19-768x402.png 768w, https://abhishek-tiwaari.github.io/ViralNewsBuzz/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/anxietyvscovid19.png 1199w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p style="font-size:22px">The researchers suggest that, in some people, the isolation, fear of contracting SARS-CoV-2, and uncertainty during the pandemic may have led to the collection of symptoms that make up this new syndrome.</p>



<p style="font-size:23px"><strong>They also speculate that the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0191886918306214" target="_blank">“Big 5” personality traits</a>&nbsp;may play a role in its development. People with high neuroticism may have a higher chance of developing the syndrome. However, those with higher extraversion, conscientiousness, agreeableness, and openness may have a lower risk.</strong></p>



<p style="font-size:22px">Additionally, people with OCD tendencies may also be more at risk, as COVID-19 concerns may amplify the condition.</p>



<p style="font-size:22px"><em>MNT</em>&nbsp;spoke with Lee Chambers — who is also the founder of&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.essentialise.co.uk/" target="_blank">Essentialise</a>&nbsp;— about possible causes for this syndrome.</p>



<p style="font-size:22px">Chambers said:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote" style="font-size:23px"><p><strong>“There is a normality to the fear of the pandemic, as the virus can be deadly. The challenge is whether we have developed a pattern of excessively safe behaviors that keep us anchored into the fears. I expect there to be pockets of people who, even when vaccinated, will be continually worrying about [COVID-19] and be avoidant of anything that may heighten their risk.”</strong></p></blockquote>



<p style="font-size:22px">He also noted that because research into COVID-19 anxiety syndrome is still at a very early stage, people need to consider a range of complex factors.</p>

</script>



<p style="font-size:22px">“Some of the potential reasons why [this may happen] include high levels of exposure to social media and news, disruption to routines and anchors caused by lockdowns and restrictions, and difficulties disengaging from the threatening stimuli, including [virus] variants and the situation in other countries,” Chambers explained.</p>



<p style="font-size:28px"><strong>Are there other contributing factors?</strong></p>



<p style="font-size:22px">According to a study that appears in&nbsp;<em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.581314/full" target="_blank">Frontiers in Psychology</a></em>, several other factors may play a role in whether a person is at risk for COVID-19 anxiety syndrome.</p>



<p style="font-size:22px">Here are some to consider.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="low-tolerance-to-uncertainty" style="font-size:25px">Low tolerance to uncertainty</h3>



<p style="font-size:22px">A person’s tolerance to uncertainty, perceived vulnerability to COVID-19, and tendency to worry excessively may contribute to this new phenomenon.</p>



<p style="font-size:22px">Research also suggests that people who have a natural inclination toward illness anxiety disorder (hypochondria) — a condition that causes a healthy person to believe they are sick — may also play a role.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="media-coverage" style="font-size:25px">Media coverage</h3>



<p style="font-size:22px">COVID-19 has received extensive media coverage from news outlets and social media platforms. However, because SARS-CoV-2 is new, facts and information about how the virus develops change constantly. This may ultimately cause mistrust and anxiety among the public.</p>



<p style="font-size:22px">A plentiful amount of misinformation in social media, much of it negative, combined with politicians using the pandemic as leverage may also have contributed to the appearance of this syndrome.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-use-of-fear-to-promote-compliance" style="font-size:25px">The use of fear to promote compliance</h3>



<p style="font-size:22px">The researchers also suggest that officials’ unintentional use of fear as a method to ensure compliance to safety precautions may have fostered feelings of anxiety and excessive worry in some people.</p>



<p style="font-size:22px">They argue that a better option to ensure compliance without causing unwanted anxiety is to promote efficacy and personal empowerment through knowledge.</p>

<p style="font-size:22px">To identify COVID-19 anxiety syndrome, Profs Nikčević and Spada have developed a new evaluation tool called the COVID-19 anxiety syndrome scale (C-19ASS).</p>



<p style="font-size:22px">This assessment tool may help people experiencing this form of anxiety access the support they need.</p>

</script>



<p style="font-size:22px">According to Chambers, there are many ways to cope with COVID-19 anxiety syndrome:</p>



<ul style="font-size:22px"><li>Consider “actively seek[ing] out positive messages around improvements in the pandemic, the vaccine rollout,” and how the risk of death from the disease appears to be lessening due to new treatment options.</li><li>Take things slow despite the expectation for a rapid return to normalcy. Step outside comfort zones at an individual pace while still practicing safety measures to “ease back into a place of harmony” gradually.</li><li>Continued use of hand sanitizer and wearing disposable masks or gloves may help ease anxiety.</li><li>Explain feelings of anxiety to a trusted person to build mutual understanding. This increases confidence and allows others to provide the support needed when venturing outside the home.</li><li>Be mindful of social media and news reports that may trigger anxiety and focus attention on positive, trusted sources of information. Consider limiting exposure to media to perhaps, once a day.</li></ul>

<p style="font-size:22px">Additionally, people with COVID-19 anxiety syndrome can consider seeking the help of a mental health professional either through an in-office or teletherapy visit if that option is available.</p>



<p style="font-size:22px">Behavioral therapy or medications for treating anxiety or depression may also help those experiencing significant challenges associated with this new and evolving mental health syndrome.</p>

<p style="font-size:22px">Allu Arjun starrer Pushpa: The Rise is a blockbuster and there is no doubt about that. The film released in December last year but is still trending furiously online. From Allu Arjun’s fiery dialogues to the catchy songs, everything is a hit on the internet. Moreover, people are simply obsessed with Allu Arjun’s Srivalli hook step. So, when a video of a Korean woman simply nailing the quirky dance move surfaced online, it obviously went crazy viral.</p>

<p style="font-size:22px">The controversy over &#8216;hijab&#8217; in Karnataka is finding resonance in street protests and social media outrage across the country. The Karnataka government has defended its decision in the Karnataka High Court and argued that religious symbolism should not be worn in educational institutions which have a prescribed dress code,</p>



<p style="font-size:22px">On Wednesday, the single judge bench hearing the matter in the Karnataka High Court sent the case to the Chief Justice Ritu Raj Awasthi to set up a larger bench as the case brings up “wider issues”.</p>

<p style="font-size:22px">The state government and the colleges have stuck to their argument that a dress code must be followed and that religious clothing does not have a place in an educational institution, which depends of “equality and uniformity&#8221;.</p>



<p style="font-size:22px">The government has argued that allowing overt display of religious symbolism through clothing would &#8220;lead to a student acquiring a distinct identity&#8221; which would be &#8220;not conducive to academic environment&#8221;. The state has also defended its decision as a means to &#8220;protect public order&#8221;.]

<p style="font-size:22px">On the other hand, the&nbsp;<strong>petitioners have claimed violation of their fundamental right</strong>&nbsp;to profess their religion, and the right to freedom and dignity. The lawyers for petitioners argued before the court that the Constitution gives everyone the fundamental right to practice their religion, and barring students from attending classes due to their dress violates these fundamental rights.</p>

<p style="font-size:22px">A similar argument relating to “uniformity” were before the European Court of Human Rights in the cases involving ban on veils in France and Belgium. In both cases, in 2014 in the France veil ban issue and in 2017 Belgium case, the ECHR upheld the ban on the veils that cover the full face and head.</p>



<p style="font-size:22px">However, these bans were upheld on the grounds of gender equality concerns (France), and “preservation of the condition of living together” which allows persons to see and identify each other. However, neither of these doctrines are valid when it comes to a Hijab. The hijab is a scarf that covers only a person’s head and hair, unlike a full face veil or ‘Niqab’, which was the subject of controversy in the European cases.</p>

<p style="font-size:22px">In India, the issue of religious clothing or symbols is not new. While the Karnataka government has raised the argument that “religious symbols and clothing” cannot be allowed, other state high courts have permitted students to do so in various cases.</p>



<p style="font-size:22px">In 2016, the Kerala High Court in a case relating to dress code during the All India Pre Medical Entrance exams(AIPMT), allowed Muslim women candidates to wear hijab to the test centers.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://abhishek-tiwaari.github.io/ViralNewsBuzz/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/hijabprotest-1644380207.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-48" width="833" height="467" srcset="https://abhishek-tiwaari.github.io/ViralNewsBuzz/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/hijabprotest-1644380207.jpg 715w, https://abhishek-tiwaari.github.io/ViralNewsBuzz/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/hijabprotest-1644380207-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 833px) 100vw, 833px" /></figure>



<p style="font-size:22px">“The right of women to have the choice of dress based on religious injunctions is a fundamental right protected under Article 25(1), when such prescription of dress is an essential part of the religion. As has been noted above, that right can be negated only in any of the circumstances referred under Article 25(1). The attempt of the Board to ensure transparency and credibility of the examinations also cannot be ignored by this Court. However, the approach of the Court is always to harmoniously accommodate the competing interest without there being any conflict or repugnancy. The interest of the Board can be safeguarded by allowing the invigilator to frisk such candidates including by removing scarf. However, safeguard has to be ensured that this must be done honouring the religious sentiments of the candidates,” held the bench.</p>

<p style="font-size:22px">The single judge bench directed the CBSE to ensure that women invigilators could be appointed to frisk the women candidates to ensure that they were not conducting any malpractice or carrying cheat sheets into the exams.</p>



<p style="font-size:22px">When the CBSE challenged the judgment, a two-judge bench upheld the verdict, and noted that the CBSE itself had included the provision that “candidates coming in customary/religious dresses should report at the centre latest by 8.30 am for proper frisking”.</p>

<p style="font-size:22px">The Delhi High Court also passed similar orders in 2018, where a division bench directed the CBSE to allow a Sikh candidate wearing kara and kirpan to enter the NEET exam hall, even though the dress code banned any metal items.</p>



<p style="font-size:22px">The bench had in its order noted that the candidates, who were wearing such religious symbols, could be called in one hour early for frisking to ensure that there is no misuse of the objects.</p>



<p style="font-size:22px">In 2002, the Bombay High Court also took up a case involving ban on hijab as part of a school dress code. The court, in the Fathima Hussain Syedcase in 2002, noted that wearing of hijab was a part of essential practice of Islam as cited in various verses of the Quran. However, the court dismissed the case itself, as the girl was attending an all-girls school.</p>



<p style="font-size:22px">“A girl student not wearing the head-scarf or head covering studying in exclusive girls section cannot be said to in any manner acting inconsistent with the aforesaid verse 31 or violating any injunction provided in Holy Quran. It is not an obligatory overt act enjoined by Muslim religion that a girl studying in all girl section must wear head-covering. The essence of Muslim religion or Islam cannot be said to have been interfered with by directing petitioner not to wear headscarf in school,” noted the Bombay High Court in its verdict.</p>



<p style="font-size:26px"><strong>What do experts say?</strong></p>



<p style="font-size:22px">Speaking to News channels, senior advocate Dushyant Dave said the controversy over hijab in Karnataka was a “political issue being deliberately raised during elections&#8221;.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="555" src="https://abhishek-tiwaari.github.io/ViralNewsBuzz/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/photo-1024x555.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-49" srcset="https://abhishek-tiwaari.github.io/ViralNewsBuzz/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/photo-1024x555.jpg 1024w, https://abhishek-tiwaari.github.io/ViralNewsBuzz/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/photo-300x163.jpg 300w, https://abhishek-tiwaari.github.io/ViralNewsBuzz/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/photo-768x416.jpg 768w, https://abhishek-tiwaari.github.io/ViralNewsBuzz/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/photo.jpg 1070w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p style="font-size:22px">“The government has no right to interfere in clothing worn by a person. It is the personal freedom and choice of each person. Even if there is a dress Code, the Hijab or headscarf can be of the same colour and cloth as the rest of the uniform, so as to not violate the dress code,” said Dave.</p>



<p style="font-size:22px">Senior advocate Vikas Singh also said that the ban violated the rights to practice and profess religion enshrined under article 25 and 29 of the Constitution. “The argument of restrictions for the sake of Public order cannot arise here. Public order has to be defined in the light of causing offence or public disorder. How is that affected by a headscarf? Courts have held that carrying a kirpan for Sikhs and covering the head for Muslims is an essential religious practice,” said Singh.</p>

<p style="font-size:22px">Several hundred students protested on Monday near the residence of Maharashtra school education minister Varsha Gaikwad in Mumbai demanding that offline exams for classes X to XII be cancelled amid the coronavirus pandemic.</p>



<p style="font-size:22px">Meanwhile, Gaikwad has said, &#8220;We&#8217;ve been continuously discussing students&#8217; health &amp; safety. I told students to have discussions with me; I&#8217;ll decide further. But we also have to keep in mind the two-year loss in school students&#8217; education.&#8221;</p>

<p style="font-size:22px">The Maharashtra government, meanwhile, has said that it is unwilling to reconsider its decision to hold offline exams. It&nbsp;has also given orders to initiate an inquiry into the state-wide protests.</p>



<p style="font-size:22px">State Home Minister Dilip Walse Patil said, “I have given orders to the police department to check what all factors led to the incident. In the last two days, some videos went viral in which provocation was given to protest in Mumbai, Pune and Nagpur. This was a planned protest carried out by some organisations and we will take appropriate action against them. About the issues raised by students, the education minister and chief minister will look into the matter and will find an appropriate solution.”</p>
