<p style="font-size:22px">Actor Rajkummar Rao is on the ninth sky after his film Badhaai Do, a sequel to 2018 hit Badhaai Ho!, released in theatres. The star is enjoying all the appreciation he is receiving for playing the character of a closeted gay police officer, Shardul Thakur. People also complimented Rajkummar&#8217;s transformation in the film, as the star worked hard to get a chiselled physique. Recently, Rajkummar took to Instagram to share a before-after picture that showed the physical transformation he went through for Badhaai Do. It will be a perfect weekend motivation and help you get rid of those lazy feelings.</p>

<p style="font-size:22px">On Saturday evening,&nbsp;Rajkummar dropped a collage&nbsp;that showed him on day 1 of his training session and the final result. The second photo shows the star on Badhaai Do sets flexing his muscles and showing off his chiselled physique. &#8220;The best feeling in the world is, when you give your heart and soul to a film and to your character and get so much love in return from the audience. Thank you guys. #ShardulThakur #BadhaaiDo,&#8221; the star captioned the post.</p>

<p style="font-size:22px">Rajkummar&#8217;s post garnered several likes and comments from his followers and stars from the industry. Bhumi Pednekar, his co-star in Badhaai Do, posted a hilarious comment revealing the star&#8217;s diet to achieve this physique. &#8220;Wow. Can&#8217;t ever forget you eating skimmed milk ka paneer, vegan protein, broccoli. Mera khaana nahi digest hota tha seeing your food. You&#8217;re incredible,&#8221; she wrote.</p>

Some information may be out of date.&nbsp;Visit our&nbsp;coronavirus hub&nbsp;and follow our&nbsp;live updates page&nbsp;for the most recent information on the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>



<p style="font-size:22px">Over a year has passed since SARS-CoV-2 began to spread across the world. Its appearance, which first caused mild concern, soon turned into serious worry as more people received a diagnosis of COVID-19.</p>



<script type="text/javascript">
	atOptions = {

<p style="font-size:22px">In the beginning, scientists knew very little about this novel virus and the disease it caused. The unknowns and the virus’s remarkably rapid spread incited fear among health professionals, scientists, and the public.</p>



<p style="font-size:22px">Soon, restricted travel, lockdowns, mask mandates, and physical distancing protocols were implemented as a tactic to slow COVID-19’s spread. Widespread media coverage detailed every nuance of an ever-changing pandemic landscape as world leaders and health experts waged war on this invisible threat.</p>



<p style="font-size:22px">Worldwide, there have been over <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://covid19.who.int/" target="_blank">150 million</a> confirmed cases of COVID-19, with just over 3 million deaths attributed to the disease. According to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2021/05/05/health/cdc-model-covid-19-cases-study/index.html" target="_blank">official projections</a>, in some countries, such as the United States, the rate of new SARS-CoV-2 infections is gradually declining.</p>

</script>



<p style="font-size:22px">This decrease is likely due to increased herd immunity and the introduction of vaccines. To date, approximately&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01136-2" target="_blank">1 billion vaccine dosesTrusted Source</a>&nbsp;have been administered across the globe.</p>



<p style="font-size:22px">As a result, some countries,&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/explainers-52530518" target="_blank">such as the United Kingdom</a>, are beginning to soften protocols initially put in place to stop the spread of the virus. As lockdowns lift, many people who were unable to leave their house are now going out and enjoying life as best they can while still being mindful of safety.</p>



<p style="font-size:23px"><strong>Yet, for some, going back out and mixing with other people is a concept filled with fear and anxiety. Despite vaccines and a decrease in disease prevalence, some people experience what scientists call COVID-19 anxiety syndrome.</strong></p>



<p style="font-size:22px">Symptoms of this syndrome mimic those of other mental health conditions, including anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). And, the pandemic and related factors appear to be the cause.</p>

<p style="font-size:22px">At the beginning of the pandemic, most people were on high alert, experiencing fear and worry over the impact this virus may have. As scientists and health care professionals gained more understanding of the virus and how to treat the symptoms of COVID-19, society began to settle into a new and unfamiliar routine of living with a pandemic.</p>



<p style="font-size:22px">Throughout this global health emergency, reactions have varied widely. Some people refused to change their behavior, while others followed the rules strictly to avoid contracting the virus. However, on a larger scale, most people experienced a sudden disruption in their lives.</p>



<p style="font-size:22px">Disaster situations often have the same effect.</p>



<p style="font-size:22px">The&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.ifrc.org/en/what-we-do/disaster-management/about-disasters/what-is-a-disaster/#:~:text=A%20disaster%20is%20a%20sudden,cope%20using%20its%20own%20resources." target="_blank">International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies</a>&nbsp;classify a disaster as “a sudden, catastrophic event that severely disrupts the functioning of a community or society, causing human, material, economic, or environmental losses.”</p>



<p style="font-size:22px">A disaster can have far-reaching consequences on mental health. According to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6857396/" target="_blank">researchTrusted Source</a>, a disaster may precipitate PTSD, anxiety, and depression among the population. People with mental health conditions, women, children, and older adults are most at risk.</p>

<p style="font-size:23px"><strong>These mental health consequences of a disaster also occurred with the COVID-19 pandemic.

<p style="font-size:22px">As more understanding of pandemic-related mental health consequences evolved, scientists identified an emerging group of anxiety-related symptoms and behaviors associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. They classify this phenomenon as COVID-19 anxiety syndrome.</p>

<p style="font-size:22px">In a paper that appears in <em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7375349/" target="_blank">Psychiatry ResearchTrusted Source</a></em> in October 2020, Profs Nikčević and Spada outline the characteristics of COVID-19 anxiety syndrome, naming avoidance, compulsive symptom-checking, worrying, and threat monitoring (combined).</p>

<p style="font-size:23px"><strong>This syndrome manifests as the inability to leave the house because of COVID-19 fears, frequent checking for symptoms despite not being in a high-risk scenario, and avoiding social situations or people.</strong></p>



<p style="font-size:22px">Investigators note that people with this syndrome tend to experience increased post-traumatic stress, general stress, anxiety, health anxiety, and suicidal ideation.</p>

<p style="font-size:22px">The researchers suggest that, in some people, the isolation, fear of contracting SARS-CoV-2, and uncertainty during the pandemic may have led to the collection of symptoms that make up this new syndrome.</p>



<p style="font-size:23px"><strong>They also speculate that the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0191886918306214" target="_blank">“Big 5” personality traits</a>&nbsp;may play a role in its development. People with high neuroticism may have a higher chance of developing the syndrome. However, those with higher extraversion, conscientiousness, agreeableness, and openness may have a lower risk.</strong></p>



<p style="font-size:22px">Additionally, people with OCD tendencies may also be more at risk, as COVID-19 concerns may amplify the condition.</p>



<p style="font-size:22px"><em>MNT</em>&nbsp;spoke with Lee Chambers — who is also the founder of&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.essentialise.co.uk/" target="_blank">Essentialise</a>&nbsp;— about possible causes for this syndrome.</p>



<p style="font-size:22px">Chambers said:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote" style="font-size:23px"><p><strong>“There is a normality to the fear of the pandemic, as the virus can be deadly. The challenge is whether we have developed a pattern of excessively safe behaviors that keep us anchored into the fears. I expect there to be pockets of people who, even when vaccinated, will be continually worrying about [COVID-19] and be avoidant of anything that may heighten their risk.”</strong></p></blockquote>



<p style="font-size:22px">He also noted that because research into COVID-19 anxiety syndrome is still at a very early stage, people need to consider a range of complex factors.</p>



<script type="text/javascript">

</script>



<p style="font-size:22px">“Some of the potential reasons why [this may happen] include high levels of exposure to social media and news, disruption to routines and anchors caused by lockdowns and restrictions, and difficulties disengaging from the threatening stimuli, including [virus] variants and the situation in other countries,” Chambers explained.</p>



<p style="font-size:28px"><strong>Are there other contributing factors?</strong></p>



<p style="font-size:22px">According to a study that appears in&nbsp;<em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.581314/full" target="_blank">Frontiers in Psychology</a></em>, several other factors may play a role in whether a person is at risk for COVID-19 anxiety syndrome.</p>



<p style="font-size:22px">Here are some to consider.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="low-tolerance-to-uncertainty" style="font-size:25px">Low tolerance to uncertainty</h3>



<p style="font-size:22px">A person’s tolerance to uncertainty, perceived vulnerability to COVID-19, and tendency to worry excessively may contribute to this new phenomenon.</p>



<p style="font-size:22px">Research also suggests that people who have a natural inclination toward illness anxiety disorder (hypochondria) — a condition that causes a healthy person to believe they are sick — may also play a role.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="media-coverage" style="font-size:25px">Media coverage</h3>



<p style="font-size:22px">COVID-19 has received extensive media coverage from news outlets and social media platforms. However, because SARS-CoV-2 is new, facts and information about how the virus develops change constantly. This may ultimately cause mistrust and anxiety among the public.</p>



<p style="font-size:22px">A plentiful amount of misinformation in social media, much of it negative, combined with politicians using the pandemic as leverage may also have contributed to the appearance of this syndrome.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-use-of-fear-to-promote-compliance" style="font-size:25px">The use of fear to promote compliance</h3>



<p style="font-size:22px">The researchers also suggest that officials’ unintentional use of fear as a method to ensure compliance to safety precautions may have fostered feelings of anxiety and excessive worry in some people.</p>



<p style="font-size:22px">They argue that a better option to ensure compliance without causing unwanted anxiety is to promote efficacy and personal empowerment through knowledge.</p>

<p style="font-size:22px">To identify COVID-19 anxiety syndrome, Profs Nikčević and Spada have developed a new evaluation tool called the COVID-19 anxiety syndrome scale (C-19ASS).</p>



<p style="font-size:22px">This assessment tool may help people experiencing this form of anxiety access the support they need.</p>



<script type="text/javascript">
	atOptions = {

</script>



<p style="font-size:22px">According to Chambers, there are many ways to cope with COVID-19 anxiety syndrome:</p>



<ul style="font-size:22px"><li>Consider “actively seek[ing] out positive messages around improvements in the pandemic, the vaccine rollout,” and how the risk of death from the disease appears to be lessening due to new treatment options.</li><li>Take things slow despite the expectation for a rapid return to normalcy. Step outside comfort zones at an individual pace while still practicing safety measures to “ease back into a place of harmony” gradually.</li><li>Continued use of hand sanitizer and wearing disposable masks or gloves may help ease anxiety.</li><li>Explain feelings of anxiety to a trusted person to build mutual understanding. This increases confidence and allows others to provide the support needed when venturing outside the home.</li><li>Be mindful of social media and news reports that may trigger anxiety and focus attention on positive, trusted sources of information. Consider limiting exposure to media to perhaps, once a day.</li></ul>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-text-align-center" style="font-size:23px"><p><strong><em>“It can be easy to become frustrated because everyone is on their own journey as lockdowns ease, and some people are more comfortable than others. Being kind to ourselves and others is so important to keep ourselves from becoming fearful. A little patience with ourselves and understanding that we are all in a different place will fuel the respect and appreciation that we all have a shared human experience we are traveling through.”</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>– Lee Chambers</em></strong></p><p></p></blockquote>



<p style="font-size:22px">Additionally, people with COVID-19 anxiety syndrome can consider seeking the help of a mental health professional either through an in-office or teletherapy visit if that option is available.</p>



<p style="font-size:22px">Behavioral therapy or medications for treating anxiety or depression may also help those experiencing significant challenges associated with this new and evolving mental health syndrome.</p>

<p style="font-size:22px">As the COVID-19 pandemic enters its third year, there are reasons for optimism.</p>



<p style="font-size:22px">Firstly, vaccines are&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.bmj.com/content/375/bmj.n2582" target="_blank">reducing the number of deathsTrusted Source</a>, at least in those countries where vaccination is widely available.</p>



<p style="font-size:22px">Secondly, evidence is growing that the latest variant, Omicron, causes less severe disease than previous variants.&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.01.11.22269045v1" target="_blank">One study</a>&nbsp;in California has shown a significantly lower risk of death with Omicron than with Delta, although the paper has yet to undergo peer review.</p>

<p style="font-size:22px">However, the global death toll has been enormous, with official figures placing it at&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://covid19.who.int/" target="_blank">more than 5.75 million</a>. Of these deaths, more than 900,000 have occurred in the United States.</p>



<p style="font-size:22px">Some people dispute these numbers, claiming that COVID-19 did not actually cause many of the deaths for which the authorities held it responsible. So how are these deaths being counted?</p>



<p style="font-size:29px"><strong>Official figures</strong></p>

<p style="font-size:22px">Most countries record every death and its cause, providing a permanent legal record.

<p style="font-size:22px">The doctor who records the death must note the primary cause of death and any contributing factors on the death certificate. And therein lies the problem.</p>



<p style="font-size:22px"><strong>COVID-19 can lead to multiple problems —&nbsp;<a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/151632">pneumonia</a>,&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health-topics/respiratory-failure" target="_blank">respiratory failureTrusted Source</a>, blood clots, stroke, and heart attack — any of which might cause death.

<p style="font-size:22px">So, how many people have died&nbsp;<em>of</em>&nbsp;COVID-19, and how many have died&nbsp;<em>with</em>&nbsp;COVID-19?</p>



<p style="font-size:22px">Consider the example of an 86-year-old man in a care home with late stage&nbsp;<a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/142214">dementia</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/184130">coronary artery disease (CAD)</a>. He contracts COVID-19 but has few symptoms. Then, he dies. What was the primary cause of death?</p>



<p style="font-size:22px">One doctor might record dementia as the primary cause, with CAD and COVID-19 as contributing factors. Another might decide that COVID-19 was the primary cause as, without contracting the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the man might have lived for a few more weeks with the other two conditions.</p>

<p style="font-size:25px"><strong>The U.K. records any death that occurs within 28 days of a positive&nbsp;<a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/coronavirus-testing">PCR test</a>&nbsp;for SARS-CoV-2 as a COVID-19 death. The official U.K. COVID-19 death toll is now about&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/deaths" target="_blank">159,000</a>.</strong></p>



<p style="font-size:22px">However, a video that people have widely shared on social media has stated that the true number of COVID-19 deaths in the U.K. is&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/60145237" target="_blank">17,000</a>&nbsp;— just over one-tenth of the official number. This is the number of people for whom COVID-19 was the&nbsp;<em>only</em>&nbsp;recorded cause of death. Some people believe that this is the number that the government should publicize.</p>



<p style="font-size:22px">Similarly, in the U.S.,&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm" target="_blank">CDC dataTrusted Source</a>&nbsp;showed that COVID-19 was the sole cause of only about 5% of listed COVID-19 deaths. These data led to the former U.S. president, Donald Trump,&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/meet-the-press/fauci-pushes-back-trump-covid-death-numbers-are-real-n1252684" target="_blank">claiming on social media</a>&nbsp;that the published figures were greatly exaggerating the severity of COVID-19.</p>



<p style="font-size:25px"><strong>When doctors determine that COVID-19 is not the sole cause of death, they record other causes on the death certificate. In the U.S.,&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/covid19/mortality-overview.htm" target="_blank">at least 90%Trusted Source</a>&nbsp;of such recorded deaths had COVID-19 as the underlying cause of death rather than a contributing cause.</strong></p>



<p style="font-size:22px">So although we could say that all of these people died&nbsp;<em>with</em>&nbsp;COVID-19 and not&nbsp;<em>of</em>&nbsp;COVID-19, the disease almost certainly played a role in their deaths.</p>



<p style="font-size:29px"><strong>Excess deaths</strong></p>

<p style="font-size:22px">One way of avoiding this issue is to record excess deaths during the pandemic and attribute these to COVID-19, rather than looking at how many people had COVID-19 on their death certificate. However, this approach has its own problems.</p>



<p style="font-size:22px">Experts calculate the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://ukhsa.blog.gov.uk/2020/08/12/behind-the-headlines-counting-covid-19-deaths/" target="_blank">excess death rate</a>&nbsp;by comparing figures for a given period with the average for that same period over several previous years. So, a person looking for excess deaths in January 2022 might compare the deaths in that month with the January average for, say, the past 10 years.</p>

</script>



<p style="font-size:25px"><strong>The problem with counting excess deaths, though, is that it does not take into account changes in populations. In many countries, populations are getting older.</strong></p>



<p style="font-size:22px">In 2000, over-65s accounted for approximately&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/3217494/10166544/KS-02-19%E2%80%91681-EN-N.pdf/c701972f-6b4e-b432-57d2-91898ca94893" target="_blank">1 in 8 people</a>&nbsp;in both Europe and the U.S. By 2020,&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Population_structure_and_ageing#The_share_of_elderly_people_continues_to_increase" target="_blank">more than one-fifth</a>&nbsp;of Europeans were over the age of 65 years, and people in this age bracket made up&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://acl.gov/sites/default/files/Aging%20and%20Disability%20in%20America/2020ProfileOlderAmericans.Final_.pdf" target="_blank">one-seventh</a>&nbsp;of the U.S. population. And these numbers are increasing rapidly.</p>



<p style="font-size:22px">As populations get older, more people die. So, comparing the death rates in 2021 with those from previous years might give a skewed perspective. Some of those excess deaths would have occurred without the pandemic.</p>

<p style="font-size:22px">In addition, deaths from some causes, such as infectious diseases,&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.health.org.uk/publications/long-reads/what-has-happened-to-non-covid-mortality-during-the-pandemic" target="_blank">have decreased</a>&nbsp;during the COVID-19 pandemic due to lockdowns and physical distancing. This will affect the excess deaths figure.</p>



<p style="font-size:29px"><strong>No evidence of overcounting</strong></p>

<p style="font-size:22px">Despite misgivings from some quarters, most experts believe that COVID-19 deaths are not being overcounted. Indeed, many think that undercounting is more likely, particularly in the early months of the pandemic.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center" style="font-size:25px"><em><strong>“Early on, there was not widespread testing, so we underestimated the deaths. Now, the death data are more reliable. There may be some plus or minus, but death data are pretty accurate.”</strong></em></p>



<p class="has-text-align-center" style="font-size:24px"><strong><em>– Dr. William Schaffner</em></strong></p>



<p style="font-size:22px"><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://research.jhu.edu/bloomberg-professors/arturo-casadevall/" target="_blank">Dr. Arturo Casadevall</a>, a distinguished professor and chair of molecular microbiology and immunology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore, echoed this view.</p>



<p style="font-size:25px"><strong>“My view is that the current number of COVID-19 deaths is an undercounting simply because those deaths reflect the ones we know about, and not every death caused by this disease was recorded or diagnosed as such,” he told&nbsp;<em>MNT</em>.</strong></p>



<p style="font-size:29px"><strong>Unrecorded deaths</strong></p>



<p style="font-size:22px">Higher income countries record all deaths, noting the causes on the death certificate. This is not the case worldwide.</p>

</script>



<p style="font-size:25px"><strong>The problem of unrecorded deaths is particularly acute in low and middle income countries. When a death is unrecorded, only those who witness the death may know its cause.</strong></p>



<p style="font-size:22px">In India, the WHO has recorded&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://covid19.who.int/" target="_blank">more than 500,000</a>&nbsp;deaths due to COVID-19, but household surveys and statistical models suggest that the number could be as much as&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-00104-8" target="_blank">10 timesTrusted Source</a>&nbsp;higher. Without good data on deaths and births, the COVID-19 death toll can never be certain.</p>



<p style="font-size:25px"><strong>Time will tell</strong></p>

<p style="font-size:22px">The true death toll of COVID-19 may not be known for many years. Many experts also believe that the final numbers should also include those who died not with COVID-19 but because of it.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center" style="font-size:25px"><strong><em>“The number of deaths attributed to COVID-19 does not include other deaths associated with the pandemic, such as those caused by the absence of proper care for other conditions because the healthcare system was focused on COVID-19, and much routine care such as cancer screening was slowed or postponed.”</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-text-align-center" style="font-size:23px"><strong><em>– Dr. Arturo Casadevall</em></strong></p>



<p style="font-size:22px">While the pandemic continues, it will be difficult to get a true figure for global deaths. “Death data are a lagging indicator. They are pretty reliable, but it takes longer for people to die and the data to be collected,” Dr. Schaffner cautioned.</p>



<p style="font-size:22px">However long it takes for the true figures to emerge, the COVID-19 pandemic has inflicted, and continues to inflict, an appalling global death toll. And it is becoming clear that the figures are almost certainly underreported, as Dr. Casadevall explained:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center" style="font-size:25px"><strong><em>“I think that in coming years, we will see revisions to this number with higher estimates of total deaths as we come to better understand the toll of this calamity.”</em></strong></p>
